## Installation

Bittybot is a 2 wheeled tail dragger robot, using a Arduino Mega 2560. The basic motor hook up is pictured in the directory.  A ultrasonic, DHT11 Temperature sensor, and voltage sensor where added, and are documented in the code. 

## Usage

This is a work in progress, there are logic errors in the current code, and I'm working on tracking them down. This code will change over time.
